# Chess 

Just a Terminal Chess in different Programming Languages

## Introduction

This project does not show an optimal, best, fastest and greatest variant to develop chess in the respective languages. The project served only personal educational purposes. Since chess is one of the most complex board games and already after 2 moves 72.084 possible positions can arise, it may well be the case that this implementation still contains a bug. The logic behind chess is the same in all languages. If an error is discovered, please let me know.

## Running 

The games can be started in different ways. It could be loaded into an IDE of choice and started there, or via command line.

### Java

```bash
$ cd src
$ javac Main.java 
$ java Main
```

### Python

```bash
$ cd src
$ python3 main.py
```

### GoLang

```bash
$ cd src
$ go run main.go
```

### C / C++

> Currently the C++ project is only a copied and adapted variant of the C project. Generally no problem, this is also a valid way to program C++. Nevertheless, an OOP variant is in development. The main focus is on new languages. Therefore the OOP variant of the C++ project may take some time. 

```bash
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./chess
```

## Progress 

There are plenty of other languages that should be implemented in this project. The most common ones (Java, Python, C/C++, ...) have already been implemented. Other languages like Rust and Ruby of course will follow.  

## Contact

- If you have discovered any bugs or have any further ideas for optimization or improvement, feel free to contact me. Feel free to leave suggestions for additional languages.
