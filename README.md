# Chess 

Just a Terminal Chess in different Programming Languages

## Introduction

This project does not show an optimal, best, fastest and greatest variant to develop chess in the respective languages. The project served only personal educational purposes. Since chess is one of the most complex board games and already after 2 moves 72.084 possible positions can arise, it may well be the case that this implementation still contains a bug. The logic behind chess is the same in all languages. If an error is discovered, please let me know.

## Start the games

The games can be started in different ways. It could be loaded into an IDE of choice and started there, or via command line.

### Java

```bash
$ cd src
$ javac Main.java 
$ java Main
```

### Python

```bash
$ cd src
$ python3 main.py
```

### GoLang

```bash
$ cd src
$ go run main.go
```

### C

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./chess
```
